## Following resources are included in this repo:
1. [Pipeline](https://github.com/WeVoicePlus/Natasha-s-work/blob/master/data/data.py) to upload annotated datasets to Azure CustomVision.
2. [iCrawler script](https://github.com/WeVoicePlus/Natasha-s-work/blob/master/img_crawler/icr.py) to webcrawl images to make datasets.
3. [Predict](https://github.com/WeVoicePlus/Natasha-s-work/blob/master/predict.py) a whole folder of images, instead of one by one in the portal.

Let me know if there's some other functionality you'd need, or just open an issue.
